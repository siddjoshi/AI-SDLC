**Notations**: C4 Model, UML 2.0, ArchiMate 3.0

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
**Template**: `templates/NFR_Template.md`

Comprehensive non-functional requirements covering quality attributes and constraints.

**Key Areas:**
- **Security Requirements**
  - Authentication (MFA, SSO, session management)
  - Authorization (RBAC, permissions)
  - Data Security (encryption at rest and in transit)
  - Network Security (WAF, DDoS protection)
  - Application Security (OWASP Top 10 protection)
  - Security Monitoring and Logging
  - Compliance (GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001)

- **Performance Requirements**
  - Response Time targets
  - Throughput (TPS, concurrent users)
  - Scalability (horizontal/vertical)
  - Resource Utilization
  - Caching Strategy

- **Accessibility Requirements**
  - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
  - Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust (POUR) principles

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Manual Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddjoshi/AI-SDLC.git
   cd AI-SDLC
   ```

2. **Copy Templates to Your Project**
   ```bash
   # Create a docs directory in your project
   mkdir -p my-project/docs
   
   # Copy the templates you need
   cp templates/BRD_Template.md my-project/docs/BRD.md
   cp templates/Functional_Spec_Template.md my-project/docs/Functional_Spec.md
   cp templates/HLD_Template.md my-project/docs/HLD.md

   ```

3. **Fill in the Templates**
   - Start with the BRD to capture business requirements
   - Move to FSD for detailed functional specifications
   - Create HLD for technical design
   - Use Architecture Diagram templates for visual representations
   - Complete NFR for quality attributes

### For AI-Assisted Use

1. **Review AI Agent Instructions**
   - See `AGENTS.md` for detailed workflow instructions for AI agents
   - The workflow guides AI agents through creating comprehensive documentation

2. **Provide Business Requirements**
   - Give AI agents your business requirement or project description
   - Request "Plan and Design" documentation

3. **AI Workflow**
   The AI agent will:
   - Create BRD from business requirements
   - Generate detailed FSD based on BRD
   - Design HLD with technical architecture
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Define comprehensive NFRs covering security, performance, and accessibility

4. **Output Location**
   - All generated documents will be in the `docs/` directory
   - Architecture diagrams in `docs/diagrams/`

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Example 1: E-Commerce Platform

**Business Requirement**: 
"Build an e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, add items to cart, and checkout with payment processing."

**AI Agent Workflow**:
1. Creates `docs/BRD.md` with business objectives, stakeholders, scope, and high-level requirements
2. Generates `docs/Functional_Spec.md` with detailed features for product browsing, cart management, checkout flow, and payment integration
3. Designs `docs/HLD.md` with architecture for web application, API services, database, and payment gateway integration
4. Creates architecture diagrams in `docs/diagrams/` (system context, containers, components, deployment)
5. Produces `docs/NFR.md` with security requirements (PCI-DSS compliance), performance targets, and accessibility standards

### Example 2: Healthcare Management System

**Business Requirement**:
"Develop a patient management system for a clinic with appointment scheduling, electronic health records, and billing."

**Generated Documentation**:
