# Phase 1.1 – Business Strategist Prompt (Business Case, Vision & Goals)

## Role Mission
Ground the initiative with a quantified business case and clearly articulated vision so later phases inherit unambiguous KPIs, dependencies, and approval expectations.

## Inputs & References
| Source | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Repository guidance | `README.md` | Confirms mandatory inception artefacts, compliance expectations, and downstream dependencies. |
| Opportunity intake | Provided business idea / executive mandate | Establishes initial problem statement, market context, and constraints. |
| Templates | ` templates/BRD.md`, ` templates/PRD.md` | Identify KPI tables and sections that must be pre-populated or referenced. |

## Expected Outputs
| Artefact | Destination | Format | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Business Case | `docs/inception/business-case.md` | Markdown | Include embedded change log, approvals table, KPI catalogue, and ROI analysis. |
| Vision & Goals | `docs/inception/vision-and-goals.md` | Markdown | Tie goals to KPI IDs, personas, and success criteria referenced later in PRD/SRS. |
| Change Log Entry | `docs/change-log.md` | Markdown | Record baseline decisions, outstanding questions, owners, due dates. |

## Procedure
1. **Confirm Mandatory Expectations** – Review `README.md` to list inception deliverables, compliance guardrails, and approval workflow captured in RACI.
2. **Analyse Opportunity & Market** – Summarise problem, target segments, personas, market sizing, competitors, and regulatory triggers; document assumptions for validation.
3. **Draft Business Case** – Create `docs/inception/business-case.md`; complete executive summary, strategic alignment, qualitative/quantitative benefits, ROI model, cost estimates, risks, assumptions, and KPI table (baseline, target, cadence, data source, KPI ID).
4. **Author Vision & Goals** – Create `docs/inception/vision-and-goals.md`; articulate vision statement, guiding principles, measurable goals mapped to Business Case KPIs, personas, journeys, and success criteria that will flow into PRD.
5. **Document Dependencies & Questions** – Append dependency list (stakeholder alignment, compliance reviews, technology assessments, funding gates) and log open questions with owners and due dates in both documents and the change log.
6. **Versioning & Approvals** – Populate document control, change log, and approvals tables; identify reviewers/approvers aligned to stakeholder register requirements.
7. **Change Log Update** – Add summary of Business Case/Vision baseline, KPIs, pending risks, and unresolved decisions to `docs/change-log.md` with owner + due date.

## Traceability & Governance
- Assign KPI IDs that will map directly into ` templates/BRD.md` and ` templates/PRD.md`.
- Cross-reference dependencies for stakeholder register, RACI, and communication plan prompts.
- Capture assumptions requiring validation and ensure they are logged with accountable owners.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Business Case and Vision & Goals stored under `docs/inception/` with no placeholder text.
- [ ] KPIs, risks, and assumptions explicitly trace to future requirements templates.
- [ ] Document control, approvals, and embedded change logs populated.
- [ ] `docs/change-log.md` updated with decisions, dependencies, and open questions.

## Parallelisation Notes
This prompt must finish before any other SDLC prompt runs. Subsequent prompts rely on the baselined Business Case and Vision & Goals artefacts.
