# Phase 1.2 – Portfolio Manager Prompt (Stakeholder Register, RACI, Communication Plan)

## Role Mission
Establish stakeholder governance artefacts that downstream phases can consume for approvals, communication cadences, and escalation paths without additional clarification.

## Inputs & References
| Source | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Business Case | `docs/inception/business-case.md` | Extract KPIs, risks, assumptions, funding details, strategic context. |
| Vision & Goals | `docs/inception/vision-and-goals.md` | Identify personas, success criteria, guiding principles. |
| Governance instructions | `README.md`, `docs/change-log.md` | Confirm mandatory artefacts, approval expectations, outstanding questions. |

## Expected Outputs
| Artefact | Destination | Format | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Stakeholder Register | `docs/inception/stakeholder-register.md` | Markdown | Include governance metadata, decision rights, influence/interest, availability, approval obligations. |
| RACI Matrix | `docs/inception/raci-matrix.md` | Markdown | Cover every artefact listed in `README.md`; ensure each has Accountable role. |
| Communication Plan | `docs/inception/communication-plan.md` | Markdown | Detail cadences, channels, artefacts shared, escalation paths. |
| Change Log Entry | `docs/change-log.md` | Markdown | Capture new stakeholders, cadence decisions, open actions. |

## Procedure
1. **Ingest Prior Artefacts** – Review Business Case and Vision & Goals; collate initiatives, KPIs, risks, compliance triggers, assumed sponsors.
2. **Create Stakeholder Register** – Produce `docs/inception/stakeholder-register.md` with tables for persona/name, organisation, role, responsibilities, decision rights, influence/interest scores, communication preferences, availability, approval obligations, and artefact responsibilities.
3. **Derive RACI Matrix** – Build `docs/inception/raci-matrix.md`; list each mandatory artefact (BRD, PRD, SRS, NFR, HLD, LLD, Test Plan, Release Notes, Rollback Plan, etc.) and assign Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed roles. Add notes for overload or conflicts.
4. **Author Communication Plan** – Draft `docs/inception/communication-plan.md`; define meeting cadence, audiences, artefacts circulated, communication channels, escalation triggers, milestone calendar, tooling integrations.
5. **Traceability Hooks** – Document stakeholder IDs and mapping guidance to approval tables within templates (BRD, HLD, Test Plan, Release Notes). Include summary table referencing ID patterns.
6. **Versioning & Approvals** – Complete document control, change log, and approvals tables for each artefact; identify Portfolio Manager sign-off.
7. **Update Change Log** – Log newly identified stakeholders, communication cadences, governance decisions, and outstanding actions with owners and due dates.

## Traceability & Governance
- Ensure stakeholder IDs align with upcoming RTM approval references and template tables.
- Clarify escalation paths matching communication plan triggers for later phases.
- Highlight dependencies requiring follow-up in requirements, design, and release prompts.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Stakeholder register, RACI, and communication plan stored under `docs/inception/` with complete content.
- [ ] Every SDLC artefact has named Responsible and Accountable parties.
- [ ] Communication plan documents cadence, channels, and escalation paths.
- [ ] Change log updated with governance decisions, new stakeholders, pending items.

## Parallelisation Notes
Phase 2 prompts may begin only after these governance artefacts are baselined. Maintain change log alignment for any updates impacting downstream personas.
