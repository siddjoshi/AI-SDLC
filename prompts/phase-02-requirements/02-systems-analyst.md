# Phase 2.2 – Systems Analyst Prompt (Functional & System Requirements Specification)

## Role Mission
Translate business and product requirements into a complete SRS and initialise the RTM to guarantee end-to-end traceability across the SDLC.

## Inputs & References
| Source | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| BRD | `docs/requirements/BRD.md` | Understand objectives, scope, constraints, stakeholder expectations. |
| PRD | `docs/requirements/PRD.md` | Extract personas, feature catalogue, acceptance criteria, analytics. |
| Governance artefacts | `docs/inception/stakeholder-register.md`, `docs/inception/raci-matrix.md`, `docs/inception/communication-plan.md` | Confirm approvals, workshops, and consultation cadence. |
| Backlog context | `docs/change-log.md` (latest entries) | Identify outstanding questions, risks, dependencies. |
| Templates | ` templates/SRS.md`, ` templates/RTM.md`, ` templates/NFR.md` (reference) | Provide structure for SRS/RTM and ensure alignment with NFR catalogue. |

## Expected Outputs
| Artefact | Destination | Format | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Software Requirements Specification | `docs/requirements/SRS.md` | Markdown | Populate all sections including detailed requirement IDs, use cases, data specs, NFR summary. |
| Requirements Traceability Matrix (initial) | `docs/requirements/RTM.md` | Markdown | Link BRD/PRD IDs to SRS IDs and seed design/test/backlog columns. |
| Change Log Update | `docs/change-log.md` | Markdown | Record SRS/RTM baseline, open decisions, queries with owners. |
| Optional Questions Log | `docs/requirements/questions.md` (if needed) | Markdown | Catalog outstanding clarifications for follow-up. |

## Procedure
1. **Context Validation** – Review BRD/PRD to confirm scope, priorities, constraints, compliance needs; capture open issues for resolution workshops.
2. **Assemble SRS** – Clone ` templates/SRS.md` into `docs/requirements/SRS.md`; complete system overview, functional requirements, use cases, data requirements, interface specs, business rules, compliance constraints, change management.
3. **Model “To-Be” Scenarios** – Document process flows, state diagrams, data flow narratives, exception paths, and alternate scenarios; reference supporting diagrams under `docs/diagrams/` if created.
4. **Define Requirement IDs** – Use consistent scheme (e.g., SRS-FUNC-001) and map each to originating BRD/PRD IDs within the SRS tables.
5. **Seed RTM** – Clone ` templates/RTM.md` into `docs/requirements/RTM.md` (if absent); map BRD/PRD IDs → SRS IDs → future design/test/backlog artefacts. Highlight missing links and assign owners.
6. **Align Non-Functional Requirements** – Extract NFR candidates from PRD; note references to ` templates/NFR.md` for Product Operations; flag critical performance/security/accessibility items for architects and QA.
7. **Collaboration Planning** – Schedule walkthrough sessions per communication plan; list attendees and goals. Document open actions within SRS and change log.
8. **Version & Approval Tables** – Update document control, change log, and approvals in both SRS and RTM; note pending approvals with due dates.
9. **Change Log Update** – Summarise SRS/RTM status, gaps, risks, and follow-up items in `docs/change-log.md`.

## Traceability & Governance
- Ensure each SRS requirement maps back to BRD/PRD IDs and forward to RTM entries.
- Provide architects with consolidated integration points, data entities, interface specs.
- Notify Test Lead of critical acceptance criteria and NFR drivers affecting planning.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] SRS completed with unique IDs, detailed scenarios, and no placeholder text.
- [ ] RTM seeded with ≥90% coverage of BRD/PRD requirements; gaps have owners and dates.
- [ ] Non-functional considerations flagged for NFR catalogue and downstream validation.
- [ ] Change log updated with decisions, risks, questions, and approval status.

## Parallelisation Notes
Product Operations (Phase 2.3) may begin once the SRS draft is available; maintain RTM and change log synchronisation for updates.
