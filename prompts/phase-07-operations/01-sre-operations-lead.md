# Phase 7.1 – SRE / Operations Lead Prompt (Incident Response & Telemetry Validation)

## Role Mission
Ensure operational readiness by validating telemetry coverage, documenting incident response procedures, and confirming service-level commitments for post-release operations.

## Inputs & References
| Source | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Release artefacts | `docs/release/deployment-runbook.md`, `docs/release/RollbackPlan.md`, `docs/release/ReleaseNotes.md`, `docs/release/support-readiness-checklist.md` | Understand deployment process, rollback, support readiness, known issues. |
| Testing & requirements | `docs/testing/TestPlan.md`, `docs/requirements/RTM.md`, `docs/requirements/NFR.md` | Confirm validation scope, operational targets, traceability. |
| Design & development | `docs/design/HLD.md`, `docs/design/LLD/`, `docs/design/threat-model.md`, `docs/development/cicd-spec.md`, `docs/development/environment-matrix.md`, `docs/development/sbom-strategy.md` | Align telemetry, controls, and operational tooling with architecture and pipeline. |
| Governance | `docs/inception/stakeholder-register.md`, `docs/inception/communication-plan.md`, `docs/change-log.md` | Determine escalation paths, notification cadence, outstanding risks. |

## Expected Outputs
| Artefact | Destination | Format | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Incident Response Playbook | `docs/operations/incident-response.md` | Markdown | Document alerting thresholds, workflows, escalation, communications, post-incident actions. |
| Observability Status Report | `docs/operations/observability-status.md` | Markdown | Summarise telemetry coverage, dashboards, gaps, remediation plans. |
| RTM Update | `docs/requirements/RTM.md` | Markdown | Map operational readiness evidence to requirement/NFR IDs. |
| Change Log Update | `docs/change-log.md` | Markdown | Record readiness status, gaps, risks, remediation actions. |

## Procedure
1. **Telemetry Verification** – Review HLD/LLD, NFRs, Test Plan, deployment artefacts to compile monitoring/logging requirements; validate actual telemetry in staging/pre-prod; document gaps and remediation actions.
2. **Author Incident Response Playbook** – Create `docs/operations/incident-response.md`; outline alert thresholds, detection methods, runbooks, escalation paths, communication templates, on-call rotations, post-incident review process, alignment with rollback plan.
3. **Draft Observability Status Report** – Produce `docs/operations/observability-status.md`; summarise dashboards, metrics, logs, traces, alert health, gaps, remediation timelines, ownership, evidence locations.
4. **Traceability Updates** – Update RTM to link operational requirements (availability, reliability, security monitoring) with incident response and observability artefacts; flag deficiencies with owners.
5. **Change Log & Communication** – Record readiness status, gaps, remediation plans, and stakeholder notifications in change log; coordinate with Release Manager, Change Manager, Service Owner.
6. **Versioning & Approvals** – Populate document control, change log, approvals for each new artefact; secure sign-off from SRE Lead/Operations leadership.

## Traceability & Governance
- Tie incident response workflows and telemetry evidence to NFR targets (availability, reliability, security).
- Provide Service Owner & Agile Coach with list of operational insights and improvement candidates.
- Confirm telemetry evidence storage meets compliance/audit requirements.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Incident response playbook and observability report completed without placeholders; gaps documented with remediation plans.
- [ ] RTM updated with operational readiness coverage; outstanding gaps assigned owners and dates.
- [ ] Change log reflects operational posture, risks, actions, and communications.
- [ ] Stakeholders informed of readiness status and follow-up steps.

## Parallelisation Notes
Phase 7.2 activities can start once initial operational status is documented; update RTM and change log as telemetry gaps close.
