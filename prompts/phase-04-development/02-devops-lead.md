# Phase 4.2 – DevOps Lead Prompt (CI/CD Architecture & SBOM Strategy)

## Context
- **Prerequisites:** Coding standards and iteration plan drafted (Phase 4.1); HLD/LLD, threat model, API specs, data design available; RTM updated; change log current.
- **Reference Artefacts:** `docs/development/coding-standards.md`, `docs/development/iteration-plan.md`, `docs/design/HLD.md`, `docs/design/threat-model.md`, `docs/design/api-specs/`, `docs/design/data-architecture.md`, `docs/requirements/NFR.md`, `docs/requirements/RTM.md`.
- **Downstream Dependencies:** QA/Test (Phase 5), Release (Phase 6), Operations (Phase 7).

## Objective
Define the continuous delivery pipeline, environment strategy, and SBOM governance to satisfy quality, compliance, and operational requirements.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Pipeline Requirements Gathering**
   - Extract quality gates, security controls, and compliance obligations from NFR catalogue, threat model, and coding standards.
   - Validate required environments and deployment topology from HLD/LLD.
2. **Author CI/CD Specification**
   - Create `docs/development/cicd-spec.md` outlining pipeline stages, tooling, workflow triggers, branch policies, automated test stages, promotion criteria, approvals, and monitoring hooks.
   - Incorporate observability and rollback hooks required by Release and Operations teams.
3. **Define Environment & Infrastructure Matrix**
   - Document environment purpose, configuration, access controls, data management, and dependencies in `docs/development/environment-matrix.md`.
   - Align with iteration plan scheduling.
4. **SBOM & Supply Chain Security**
   - Specify SBOM generation, storage, validation, and compliance reporting. Include third-party dependency scanning, licence checks, and attestation steps.
   - Capture requirements in `docs/development/sbom-strategy.md` and reference within CI/CD spec.
5. **Traceability & Collaboration**
   - Update RTM with CI/CD stage references addressing requirements/NFRs.
   - Coordinate with QA to integrate test suites and with Release Manager on deployment readiness evidence.
   - Log decisions, risks, and blockers in change log.

## Deliverables
- `docs/development/cicd-spec.md`
- `docs/development/environment-matrix.md`
- `docs/development/sbom-strategy.md`
- Updated `docs/requirements/RTM.md`
- Change log entries capturing pipeline decisions and dependencies

## Traceability & Handover Requirements
- Link pipeline stages to requirements and NFRs in RTM.
- Provide QA with test integration points and data needs; inform Release/Operations of deployment evidence generated by pipeline.
- Highlight tooling or infrastructure requests to engineering leadership.

## Completion Criteria
- CI/CD spec approved with clear roles, quality gates, and automation coverage.
- Environment matrix and SBOM strategy documented with no placeholders; responsibilities assigned.
- RTM updated, risks logged, and stakeholders briefed on next steps.

## Parallelisation Notes
- Engineering Team Readiness (Phase 4.3) can proceed concurrently, referencing pipeline readiness; QA planning (Phase 5) can begin once CI/CD stages are defined.
