## 1. Executive Summary
### 1.1 Purpose
_Define the purpose: to establish clear accountability, responsibility, consultation, and information flow for all key activities and deliverables._

### 1.2 RACI Overview
- **R – Responsible:** Does the work to complete the task.
- **A – Accountable:** Ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion (only ONE per activity).
- **C – Consulted:** Provides input, expertise, and feedback (two-way communication).
- **I – Informed:** Kept up-to-date on progress (one-way communication).

### 1.3 Governance Principles
- Each activity must have exactly ONE Accountable person.
- Multiple people can be Responsible, Consulted, or Informed.
- Roles should be assigned by name or role title, not generic groups.
- RACI must be reviewed and updated as the project evolves.
