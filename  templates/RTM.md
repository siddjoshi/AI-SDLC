# Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

## Document Control
| Version | Date | Author | Reviewer | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| 0.1     |      |        |          | Draft |
| 1.0     |      |        |          | Baseline |

## Purpose
Provide end-to-end traceability from business intent through design, implementation, testing, and deployment to ensure completeness and compliance.

## Usage Guidelines
- _Maintain bidirectional traceability between BRD/PRD, SRS, design specs, code commits, test artefacts, defects, and deployment evidence._
- _Update the RTM at each stage gate (requirements sign-off, design approval, test readiness, release)._ 
- _Highlight coverage gaps, orphan requirements, and verification status._

## Traceability Matrix
| Req ID | Requirement Type (Business / Functional / NFR / Compliance) | Requirement Description | Priority | Source Document & Section | Design / Architecture Reference | User Story / Work Item | Code Reference (Branch/Commit) | Test Case IDs | Defect IDs | Status (Not Started / In Progress / Verified / Blocked / Deferred) | Verification Evidence | Comments |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|
|        |                                                             |                         |          |                            |                               |                        |                               |               |            |                                                                   |                       |          |

## Coverage Summary
| Requirement Category | Total Requirements | Covered by Design | Covered by Test | Pending Coverage | Coverage % |
|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Business             |                    |                   |                 |                  |            |
| Functional           |                    |                   |                 |                  |            |
| Non-Functional       |                    |                   |                 |                  |            |
| Compliance           |                    |                   |                 |                  |            |

## Status Legend
- **Not Started**: Requirement documented but no downstream artefacts linked.
- **In Progress**: Design or implementation underway; partial traceability exists.
- **Verified**: Requirement validated through testing with evidence captured.
- **Blocked**: Progress impeded by dependency, issue, or risk.
- **Deferred**: Requirement postponed to a future release with rationale documented.

## Change Log
| Change ID | Date | Description | Impacted Requirements | Owner | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------------------|-------|-------|
|           |      |             |                        |       |       |

## Governance & Review Cadence
- _Frequency of updates (e.g., weekly, per sprint, per PI)._ 
- _Review forums (architecture board, QA governance, change advisory board)._ 
- _Approvers and sign-off expectations._

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Every requirement has unique ID, priority, and source reference.
- [ ] All requirements link to design artefacts and implementation work items.
- [ ] Each requirement has associated verification evidence (test cases, results).
- [ ] Non-functional and compliance requirements have explicit validation coverage.
- [ ] Coverage summary highlights gaps with remediation plans and owners.
- [ ] Change log captures requirement updates with impact analysis.
- [ ] RTM aligns with current release scope, with deferred items clearly marked.
- [ ] Approvals and review cadence are defined and communicated to stakeholders.
