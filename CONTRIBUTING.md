## üìù Template Guidelines

When creating or modifying templates, please follow these guidelines:

### Template Structure

1. **Document Control Section**
   - Include version control table
   - Add date, author, and changes columns

2. **Clear Headings**
   - Use hierarchical headings (##, ###, ####)
   - Maintain consistent numbering scheme
   - Keep section titles descriptive and concise

3. **Tables for Structured Data**
   - Use markdown tables for requirements, risks, stakeholders, etc.
   - Include relevant columns (ID, Description, Priority, etc.)

4. **Comments and Placeholders**
   - Use HTML comments `<!-- -->` for instructions
   - Provide examples where helpful
   - Indicate optional vs. required sections

5. **Industry Standards**
   - Reference relevant industry standards
   - Align with IEEE, ISO, OWASP, WCAG, etc.
   - Include compliance requirements where applicable

### Template Content Requirements

- **Comprehensive**: Cover all relevant aspects of the document type
- **Clear**: Use plain language, avoid jargon where possible

- **Consistent**: Follow the same style and format as existing templates
- **Professional**: Maintain a professional tone and structure

## üé® Style Guide

### Markdown Formatting

- Use **bold** for emphasis on important terms
- Use `code blocks` for technical terms, file paths, and code
- Use tables for structured data
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include emoji where appropriate for visual appeal (e.g., üìã, üîí, ‚ö°)

### Document Naming

- Use descriptive names: `BRD_Template.md`, not `template1.md`
- Use underscores for multi-word file names
- Include version info if applicable
- Keep names concise but clear

### Writing Style

- Write in clear, professional English
- Use active voice where possible
- Keep sentences concise
- Use technical terms accurately
- Define acronyms on first use
